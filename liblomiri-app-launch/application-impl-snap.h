/** Class implementing a Applications that are installed in the
    system as Snaps. This class connects to snapd to get information
    on the interfaces of the installed snaps and sees if any of them
    are applicable to the user session. Currently that means if the
    command has the mir, lomiri, unity7 or x11 interfaces.

    For Application IDs snaps use a very similar scheme to Click
    packages. The package field is the name of the snap package, typically
    this is the overall application name. The appname is the command
    in the snap package, which needs to be associated with one of our
    supported interfaces and have a desktop file. Lastly the version
    field is actually the snap revision, this value changes even on
    updates between channels of the same version so it provides a
    greater amount of uniqueness.
