/** Application Implementation for Legacy applications. These are applications
    that are typically installed as Debian packages on the base system. The
    standard place for them to put their desktop files is in /usr/share/applications
    though other directories may be used by setting the appropriate XDG environment
    variables. This implementation makes use of the GIO Desktop Appinfo functions
    which do caching of those files to make access faster.

    AppIDs for legacy applications only include the Appname variable. Both the package
    and the version entries are empty strings. The appname variable is the filename
    of the desktop file describing the application with the ".desktop" suffix.

    More info: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/
